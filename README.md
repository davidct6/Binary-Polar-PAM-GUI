A MATLAB app to **generate and decode** binary polar Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) signals in noise, using a matched filter â€” all controlled through an interactive GUI.

## Features

- Adjustable parameters:
  - Number of symbols (N)
  - Symbol period (T)
  - Oversampling factor (Q)
  - Amplitude (A)
  - Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Real-time plots:
  - Noisy received PAM signal
  - Matched filter output
- User-friendly sliders and input boxes
- Resizable main window with author name and date

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `PAM_GUI.mlapp` in MATLAB App Designer or run it from the MATLAB command window.
3. Adjust the parameters and visualize the signal and filter output.
